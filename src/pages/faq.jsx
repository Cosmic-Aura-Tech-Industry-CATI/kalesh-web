      question: "What is Kalesh?",
      answer: "Kalesh is an anonymous social media platform that follows the core concepts of traditional social media, such as profiles, followers, following, likes, impressions, and content history — while fully maintaining user anonymity. It allows users to share opinions, create real-time polls, participate in discussions, and build an anonymous presence without revealing their real identity.",
      category: "basics",
      tags: ["platform", "anonymous", "social media"]
    },
    {
      question: "Is Kalesh an anonymous social media platform or a polling app?",
      answer: "Kalesh is both. It is a full-featured anonymous social media platform where users can maintain anonymous profiles, gain followers, and track impressions, while also being centered around real-time opinion polls that are broadcast live to users.",
      category: "basics",
      tags: ["platform", "polling", "social media"]
    },
    {
      question: "How is Kalesh different from traditional social media platforms?",
      answer: "Traditional social media platforms focus on real identities, public profiles, and social validation pressure. Kalesh removes real identity while retaining social media mechanics like followers, engagement, reach, and content history. This allows users to express opinions freely without fear of judgment, screenshots, or real-world consequences.",
      category: "comparison",
      tags: ["differences", "traditional social media", "anonymity"]
    },
    {
      question: "How is Kalesh different from Instagram?",
      answer: "Instagram is identity-driven and centered around curated personal branding, where reach depends heavily on follower count and image presentation. Kalesh removes identity pressure completely while still allowing users to build an anonymous presence based on opinions, engagement, and participation. Visibility on Kalesh depends on interaction, not real-world popularity.",
      category: "comparison",
      tags: ["vs Instagram", "differences", "social media"]
    },
    {
      question: "How is Kalesh different from Twitter (X)?",
      answer: "Twitter ties opinions directly to public identities, often leading to trolling, backlash, and screenshot culture. Kalesh allows users to express opinions anonymously, participate in debates, and engage in discussions without exposing their identity, making conversations more honest and less toxic.",
      category: "comparison",
      tags: ["vs Twitter", "differences", "anonymity"]
    },
    {
      question: "Is Kalesh completely anonymous?",
      answer: "Yes. Kalesh maintains full anonymity at the public level. Real names, photos, and personal identities are never shown. Users interact through anonymous profiles that represent their activity, opinions, and engagement — not their real-world identity.",
      category: "privacy",
      tags: ["anonymity", "privacy", "identity"]
    },
    {
      question: "What is an anonymous profile on Kalesh?",
      answer: "An anonymous profile on Kalesh is a social profile that displays a user's polls, comments, impressions, followers, and engagement history without revealing who the user is in real life. It allows users to build reputation and reach while remaining anonymous.",
      category: "features",
      tags: ["profile", "anonymous", "social media"]

      category: "features",
      tags: ["followers", "following", "engagement"]
    },
    {

      answer: "Yes, depending on your profile settings. Kalesh allows users to choose between public and private profile options:\n\n• Public profile → Others can see your polls and comments\n• Private profile → Your activity is hidden from profile view",
      category: "privacy",
      tags: ["profile settings", "visibility", "privacy"]
    },
    {
      question: "What is the purpose of public and private profiles?",
      answer: "Public and private profile options give users control over visibility. Some users may want to build an anonymous public presence, while others may prefer to participate privately without showcasing their activity history.",
      category: "privacy",
      tags: ["profile settings", "privacy", "control"]
    },
    {
      question: "How do real-time polls work on Kalesh?",
